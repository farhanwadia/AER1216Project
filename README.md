## Multi-Rotor Drone Development
In the `Part 2 - Multi-Rotor` folder, the range and endurance calculations can be found in the `Part2_Q1.mlx` file.
All other parts of the project (quadrotor dynamics, position estimation, position control, simulation model) can be found in the `Part2_SimulinkModel.slx` file.
This Simulink model relies on the reference input signals saved in the `input_signals.mat` file. The system response for this input has been saved in the `position_responses.mat` file, and the `multi_rotor_response_plot.m` script plots this data for use in the presentation.
